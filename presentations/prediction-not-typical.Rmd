# Prediction

A common task in data science is to predict. 

A common task in intro stats is to describe using a "typical" or "representative" value. 

The *mean* is justified as the most representative value, except when it isn't. Then we use the *median*.

* A median annual family income in the US in 2017 was $61,372. [Source](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA646N)

**Imagine that the central task in intro stats were to make a prediction**, rather than to describe what's typical.

# Format?

Set a proper format for a prediction

In intro stats, we give students a confidence interval on the mean (but not usually the median). 

* Not just a single value. 
    - Silly to say, "I predict your family has an income of $61,372." 
    - That prediction will (almost) always be wrong.
    - Common sense will lead people to look for a noticeable difference, say $5000. So round to $55 to $65K.
* Need a format that can be *demonstrably right*, and demonstrably *wrong*.
    - 100% is too big.
    - 0% is too small (using the "typical")
    - How about mean Â± standard error
        - But the standard error depends on the sample size. Paradox: the more data we have, the more often our prediction will be wrong!

To think about a standard, imagine in each setting that we will have ten assays and we want to know if our prediction is right.
    - A 95% interval? 60% of settings we will have perfect predictions for the ten assays. So hard to know if our interval was too broad.
    - An 85% interval? In 20% of settings we will have perfect predictions, but more likely 7, 8, or 9 correct -- 75% of assays.
    
Another criterion for a standard: be able to eyeball the prediction interval with, say, 50 to 100 data points.
    - 95% interval involves counting just 2 points from end: unreliable
    - 85% involves 7 points from end: more reliable.

# Group differences

Prediction of adult height in US

- Women 5' 1" to 5' 9".
- Men 5' 5" to 6' 1"

# Why do we use 95%?

Because we confuse description of variation with statistical "significance."

Let the prediction interval demonstrate the variation that's readily observable for two individuals.
